# puffball-destroys-the-world

### Game Concept
When the hero’s prophesied villain is their most loyal, loved pet…
Play as Puffball, the next harbinger of doom… who just so happens to be the hero’s childhood pet! Work around the hero’s antics, step into their battles, sneak away, and cause chaos to trigger your special ability: steal the traits of those that kill you!
Will you grow powerful enough to face the hero once they discover your true identity? 

Note: Built in Twine. Not fully finished.
